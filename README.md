# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Twitter Sentiments
#### Team: Qi Cai, Alex Karadjov


## Overview
Our team is using the Twitter Sentiment data set from [[Data.world]](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions) where we can download information that was collected by Appens Pre-Labeled Datasets where they had contributors evaluate tweets about multiple brands and products. The crowd was asked if the tweet expressed positive, negative, or no emotion towards a brand and/or product. If some emotion was expressed they were also asked to say which brand or product was the target of that emotion. 

We decided to approach this dataset with a LogisticRegression Model, after trying DecisionTrees, KNN, RandomForest, Multiclass NB, etc because we had the highest accuracy score with LR.>>>
